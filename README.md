# Distributed-Circuit-Breaker

### Description
This repo is a proof of concept of distributed circuit breaker. 

Distributed Circuit Breaker can be helpful if you need to share a circuit breaker among multiple services (or multiple instances of the same service), which means that its state is kept in external storage (Redis, Mongo and so on...) as opposed to service instance memory.
